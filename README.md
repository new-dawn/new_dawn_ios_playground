# New Dawn iOS Repo
iOS repository for project New Dawn

## Setup
1. Clone the repo to your local machine by running `git clone https://github.com/new-dawn/new_dawn_ios.git`. You can then add your changes in `new_dawn_ios/`. Run `git pull --rebase origin master` frequently so you can rebase your code to master branch.
2. In your local repo, run `git branch <yourname>` and `git checkout <yourname>` to create your own branch.
3. Write code in your branch. Run `git add -A` to include all your local changes. Then run `git commit -m "<your message>"` to commit your changes locally.
4. Run `git push origin <yourname>` to push your local changes to your own branch on Github.
5. Create Pull Request when you are ready to merge your branch with master.

## Dev
1. Made changes in NewDawn.xcworkspace instead of NewDawn.xcodeproj
